PDFfit2 - real space structure refinement program.

PDFfit2 is normally installed as part of DiffPy, a python library for
structure investigations from diffraction data.  To install PDFfit2 only:

PDFFit2 requires development files for Python and GNU Scientific Library. 
These are available as Fedora packages python-devel and gsl-devel.
